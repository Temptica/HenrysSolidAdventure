Otterly Adventure

Otterly the otter's girlfriend has been kidnapped by an evil person. Otterly must go on an adventure to save her.

The only way to get her back is by defeating the evil person. Troughout the levels, there are mistery boxes to collect, each can give you positive or negative stat upgrades.

Are you abel to save her or will you die for her?


dev idea's:
have a super rare weapon that can be found in the mistery boxes, it's called the "Otterly" and it's a gun that shoots otters. It's a one shot kill, but it's very rare to find. It's a reference to the game's name.
